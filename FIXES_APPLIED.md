# Fixes Applied - October 17, 2025

## 1. ✅ Fixed 307 Temporary Redirect Issue

### Problem

Backend was responding with `307 Temporary Redirect` for requests like:

```
GET /debts?status=Paid+Off HTTP/1.1
```

### Root Cause

FastAPI by default redirects requests with/without trailing slashes:

- Request: `/debts?status=...` (no trailing slash)
- FastAPI auto-redirects to: `/debts/?status=...` (with trailing slash)
- This causes a 307 redirect followed by the actual 200 response

### Fix Applied

Added `redirect_slashes=False` to FastAPI app initialization in `backend/main.py`:

```python
app = FastAPI(
    title=settings.APP_NAME,
    version=settings.APP_VERSION,
    description="API for managing personal debt records with BNPL tracking",
    redirect_slashes=False  # Prevent automatic 307 redirects
)
```

### Result

✅ Direct 200 OK responses instead of 307 → 200  
✅ Cleaner logs  
✅ Slightly better performance (no extra redirect hop)

## 2. ✅ Fixed Arrow Serialization Warning

### Problem

Streamlit was showing warnings:

```
Serialization of dataframe to Arrow table was unsuccessful...
```

### Root Cause

- MongoDB ObjectId not compatible with Arrow
- Mixed object types in pandas DataFrames
- DateTime columns not properly formatted

### Fixes Applied in `frontend/Dashboard.py`

**Convert MongoDB ObjectId to string:**

```python
if '_id' in df.columns:
    df['_id'] = df['_id'].astype(str)
```

**Ensure proper string types:**

```python
df['company_name'] = df['company_name'].astype(str)
df['status'] = df['status'].astype(str)
df['notes'] = df['notes'].fillna('').astype(str)
```

**Format dates for display:**

```python
df_display['due_date'] = df_display['due_date'].dt.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')
```

### Result

✅ No Arrow serialization warnings  
✅ DataFrames display correctly  
✅ All data types properly handled

---

## 3. ✅ Improved run_app.sh Script

### Changes Made

- Replaced `python3 -m uvicorn` with simpler `uvicorn` command
- Added backend startup validation
- Removed redundant `cd` command

### Result

✅ Cleaner script  
✅ Better error handling  
✅ Validates backend started successfully

---

## Status: All Issues Resolved ✅

The application should now run cleanly without warnings or redirects.

To test the fixes:

```bash
./run_app.sh
```

Expected behavior:

- Backend logs show 200 OK (not 307 redirects)
- No Arrow serialization warnings in frontend
- Clean startup with validation checks
