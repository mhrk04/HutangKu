# Documentation Consolidation Complete ✅

## Summary

All markdown documentation files have been successfully consolidated into a single, comprehensive README.md file.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Consolidated README.md**

- ENV_SETUP.md
- ENV_CONFIG_SUMMARY.md
- VENV_SETUP.md
- CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md

### 3. **Documentation Structure**
