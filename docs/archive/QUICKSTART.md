# Quick Start Guide - HutangKu - Debt Management

## ‚ö° Fast Setup (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Install MongoDB

**macOS:**

```bash
brew tap mongodb/brew
brew install mongodb-community
brew services start mongodb-community
```

**Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):**

```bash
sudo apt-get install mongodb
sudo systemctl start mongodb
```

**Windows:**
Download from: https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community

### Step 2: Setup Virtual Environment and Install Dependencies

```bash
cd Debt-Manager-Portal

# Make setup script executable
chmod +x setup.sh

# Run setup (creates venv and installs dependencies)
./setup.sh
```

**What this does:**

- Creates a Python virtual environment in `venv/`
- Activates the virtual environment
- Installs all required dependencies from `requirements.txt`

**Manual Setup (if needed):**

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
# or
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 3: Run the Application

**Option A: Using the startup script (Recommended)**

```bash
# Make script executable (first time only)
chmod +x run_app.sh

# Run the application
./run_app.sh
```

This automatically activates the virtual environment and starts both services.

**Option B: Run manually in separate terminals**

First, activate the virtual environment in both terminals:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
```

Terminal 1 (Backend):

```bash
cd Debt-Manager-Portal
uvicorn backend.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

Terminal 2 (Frontend):

```bash
cd Debt-Manager-Portal
streamlit run frontend/Home.py
```
